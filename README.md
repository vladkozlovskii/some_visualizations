# some_visualizations
repository that contains the process of creating some visualizations (some of them I rarely or don't use and I was interested in applying them to marine biology topics I am familiar with)

In this repository i use three jupyter notebooks:
- fermented milk contains analysis of similarity of different milk products and represent it by ordinations, dendrograms and clustermap
- sankey contains preparation of few Sankey diagrams
- S2_H3_maps contains working with h3 and s2 libraries, visualization this cells on the map, and preparation of .geojson files with cells data 
- radar plots with visualization of parameters of different benthic communities
- wordclouds which reveal role of the benthic species in community
- treemap which contain data of benthic biomass taking into account the taxonomy structure
